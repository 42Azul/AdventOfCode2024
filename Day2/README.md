# Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports

## Part 1 
**Difficulty:** ðŸŒ—ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘

**Approach & Solution:**
The task involved determining if lists of numbers followed some specific rules. These rules were that the list was **strictly** increasing/decreasing and two adjacent values should differ by at most **three**.

Each report was processed line by line using `istringstream`. The numbers in the list were checked to ensure:

1. The sequence was either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
2. The absolute difference between adjacent levels was between 1 and 3.

The implementation used a `sign` variable to track the trend (increasing or decreasing). If a trend break or invalid difference was found, we stop processing the line. Then we return the amount of lines which follow the trend.

## Part 2
**Difficulty:** ðŸŒ–ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘

**Approach & Solution:**
The second part extended the first by allowing a single element on the list of numbers to not follow the rules.

<summary>Detailed Explanation (Click to expand)</summary>
For each list, all possible sublists (formed by removing one value) were validated against the same rules as in Part 1. If any sublist was safe, the entire list of integers was classified as valid. This approach used a helper function to check the safety of a list with an optional skipped index. If one of the sublists is valid, then we skip checking with the other sublists.

## Conclusions and Thoughts
This challenge introduced a progression from Part 1 to Part 2, and not just copy pasting and changing it a bit. 
However, I am am not quite happy with my solution for Part 2. While it worked, it relied on a brute-force approach that involved unnecessary calculations. A better method would have been to identify the breaking point in the sequence and focus the checks only from that point onward. If removing the problematic element didn't resolve the issue, further checks would have been redundant as the list would remain invalid.

Despite this, I decided to keep the original solutions as-is. In the end, I started the challenge a bit late in the month, so I was in a rush and thus not able to figure out the perfect code solution everytime.
