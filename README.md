# Advent of Code 2024

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository  for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), wwhich contains solutions to the various problems, all implemented in C++. Even though I am currently more of a backend Java developer, I used to participate in SWERC and other competitive programming events. When I discovered AoC, I thought it would be a great opportunity to bring my competitive programming skills back to live (which differ significantly from the functional development I currently focus on).

Initially, I did not plan to create a repository. However, after discovering that AoC is not just a competitive contest but also an engaged community of users solving problems in diverse ways and languages, I decided to share my solutions. These solutions may not be the cleanest or most optimized but represent my first attempts at solving the problems.

Still, If you feel about solving any of the problems yourself, I encourage you to close this repository right now and take on the challenge directly!

## Repository Structure

This repo is organized by day, each containing two parts of the puzzle in two different files. Then inside each folder you will also find the context of the problem and the given solution.
You can jump to each day’s individual description by clicking on the respective day’s README file in the folders.

- [Day 1](Day1/README.md)
- [Day 2](Day2/README.md)
- [Day 3](Day3/README.md)
- [Day 4](Day4/README.md)
- [Day 5](Day5/README.md)
- [Day 6](Day6/README.md)
- [Day 7](Day7/README.md)
- [Day 8](Day8/README.md)
- [Day 9](Day9/README.md)
- [Day 10](Day10/README.md)
- [Day 11](Day11/README.md)

- [Day 24](Day24/README.md)
- [Day 25](Day25/README.md)

## Why Are the Inputs Not Included?

Advent of Code provides unique inputs for each participant, and in the end if we provide the context of the problems and the input, we would be sharing the page itself. To be compliant and to support Eric Wastl, we will not do so here. More info in the [FAQ For Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying)

## Future Of This Repository

Even if initially I thought about letting it static, I may come back to this repository to clean a bit some solutions, while not changing too much the original approach.

Then, as I really enhoyed the challenge, it is possible that I try to solve and upload here other years's sets of challenges.
