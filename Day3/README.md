# Day 3: Mull It Over

## Part 1  
**Difficulty:** ðŸŒ—ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘  

**Approach & Solution:**  
This task was all about reading the input in the search of `mul(X,Y)` instructions. It wasnâ€™t about anything fancyâ€”just careful parsing and ensuring you skip the unused characters.

The code scanned the input character by character, searching for patterns that matched the format `mul(X,Y)`. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:  

1. A `toCheck` string helped track whether we were mid-parsing a valid `mul` instruction.  
2. Once inside a valid `mul` block, digits for `X` and `Y` were parsed and multiplied.  
3. Any mismatched characters or sequences reset the parser to avoid errors.  
4. Finally, the results of all valid `mul` instructions were added up and printed.  

No complex algorithms hereâ€”just parsing, validating, and summing!

## Part 2  
**Difficulty:** ðŸŒ—ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ‘  

**Approach & Solution:**  
The second part added some state management by introducing `do()` and `don't()` instructions, which toggled whether `mul` operations were active.

Building on Part 1:  

1. Two new strings, `do()` and `don't()`, were used to track the active state of `mul` instructions.  
2. Each character of the input was checked against these state-changing commands.  
3. Only when the `enabled` state was `true` were valid `mul` instructions parsed and their results added to the sum.  
4. If a `don't()` appeared, subsequent `mul` instructions were ignored until a `do()` reset the state.  
5. For parsing the numbers, we just read them and multiply by 10 knowing they can not be more than 3 digits long.

The only challenge here was maintaining the different states of the parser.

## Conclusions and Thoughts  
Honestly, this puzzle felt simpler than Day 2. It was all about input parsing and keeping track of state changes, which isnâ€™t particularly groundbreaking.  

The first part was straightforwardâ€”just pick out the valid instructions and multiply the numbers. The second part added a bit more complexity with `do()` and `don't()`, but it was still pretty mechanical.  

While it was satisfying to do it quickly as I was late in the AoC challenge, this day problem didnâ€™t require much creativity.
